journ0001,Ecohydrological change following rewetting of a deep‐drained northern raised bog,10007;10008;10009;10010;10011;10012;,2020,['Ecohydrology'],"AbstractRestoration of degraded peatland ecosystems (by rewetting) is undertaken to bring back key ecosystem services. However, the restoration process can have a range of ecohydrological effects, due to the associated physical and biogeochemical disturbance. In the case of northern peatlands drained by large and deep ditches, the rewetting effects are relatively unknown. The raised bog Grande plée Bleue (1,500 ha) is one of the largest pristine bogs in the St‐Lawrence lowlands in North America; however, it contained an old (&gt;60 years), 750 m long, 3.5 m deep, and 8 m wide ditch. Rewetting of the area affected by the ditch was carried out by the construction of six dams at 40 cm elevation intervals and felling of all trees (with diameter at breast height &gt;10 cm) within 30 m. Water table was restored to levels similar to intact bog reference sites, only at elevation differences up to 17 cm from the nearest lower dam, while rewetting did not affect pore‐water chemistry. Five to 6 years post‐rewetting, the cover of both pioneer mosses, and late successional mosses (Sphagnum) had not changed significantly compared with pre‐rewetting. This may have been due to the presence of dense shrub cover. For more effective ecohydrological restoration, dams should be spaced at smaller elevation intervals (e.g., every 20 cm of elevation or less), to allow recovery of water table along the entire length of the ditch, and vegetation introduction using the moss layer transfer technique may accelerate Sphagnum recruitment, especially in the few first metres from the ditch.",,Grande plée Bleue,46.785692,-71.058227,,10.1002/eco.2210,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0001.pdf,objects/small/journ0001_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0001_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,
journ0002,Does restoration work? It depends on how we measure success,10002;10003;10004;10005;10006;,2018,['Restoration Ecology'],"The restoration of 4 partial stream barriers was evaluated in watersheds of Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland, Canada from 2009 to 2011. Brook trout (n = 462) were tagged and tracked moving through our study sites using passive‐integrated transponder telemetry and the restoration actions were assessed using 3 different measures: passage success rates; the range of passable flows; and the availability of passable flows. We considered the observed results within a before‐after‐control‐impact (BACI) design that included reference reaches and pre‐restoration observations. The conclusions of BACI analyses were also contrasted with those that would have been obtained from commonly used before‐after (B‐A) or control‐impact (C‐I) study designs. While the restoration actions changed hydrological conditions in a way that should facilitate fish passage, our biological measures indicated that success was variable across culverts and within culverts depending on the measure evaluated. Furthermore, the natural temporal and spatial variability of fish movements often resulted in different conclusions between the more robust BACI design and the more commonly used B‐A and C‐I designs. Our results demonstrate that restoration of partial barriers may not always yield dramatic improvements. Furthermore, without suitable controls, the chances of drawing false conclusions regarding restorations in temporally and spatially dynamic systems are substantial.",,Terra Nova National Park,48.53323,-53.8919401,,10.1111/rec.12649,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0002.pdf,objects/small/journ0002_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0002_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,
journ0003,Mine reclamation enhances habitats for wild ungulates in west‐central Alberta,10013;10014;,2020,['Restoration Ecology'],"Surface mining is the most prevalent form of coal extraction in North America. Reclamation aims to transform former surface mines into self‐sustaining ecosystems that support uses similar to predevelopment conditions. Success of reclamation often is determined by assessing the re‐establishment of landscape structure and vegetation communities. However, there is increasing interest in evaluating reclamation success in the context of higher trophic levels. We evaluated response to mining and reclamation by sympatric bighorn sheep (Ovis canadanesis), elk (Cervus elaphus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) on reclaimed coal mines in west‐central Alberta. We used direct ground counts on a fixed survey route to obtain data on abundance and distribution of ungulates during 2004 to 2017. We created a grid of 200 × 200 m grid cells and assigned each group of ungulates to a grid cell. We assigned landscape and topographic features to these grid cells to represent changes due to mining and reclamation. We estimated resource selection functions for bighorn sheep, elk, and mule deer showing how their use of reclaimed features and landscapes increased access to quality forage and decreased predation risk. Ungulates also responded to mining and reclamation in ways that we did not anticipate, e.g. sheep and elk often selected areas near haul roads. Understanding spatial relationships between reclamation prescriptions and higher trophic levels is important when designing “bottom up” reclamation to restore ecological functions including recruitment of wildlife.",,West-central Alberta,53.022382,-112.8354598,,10.1111/rec.13137,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0003.pdf,objects/small/journ0003_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0003_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,

Evaluation of resilience is hampered bythe short history of logging, lack of long-term experiments and methodological limitations.To test the effect of clearcut logging, prescribed burning and reforestation on forest resil-ience, we recorded vascular plant cover repeatedly after treatment between 1981 and 2008in 16 permanent research installations in three biogeoclimatic zones: Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir, Interior Cedar-Hemlock and Sub-Boreal Spruce. We created a plant-traitdataset for the 181 recorded species to define plant functional types representing groups ofplants that behave in similar ways and/or produce similar ecological outcomes. These plantfunctional types, along with taxonomic analysis of diagnostic and indicator species, werethen used to evaluate plant community response to disturbance. Twenty years post-treat-ment, species diversity increased in all zones and plant abundance was greatest in the Inte-rior Cedar-Hemlock. Cover of understory plant functional types associated with matureconifer forests increased in all zones, constituting a significant proportion (> 40%) of the veg-etation community by year 20. Response patterns varied by zone and with time. Understoryspecies diagnostic of mature forests were present in all zones by year 20, but we identifiedindicator species sensitive to slashburning or requiring more time for recovery, includingwhite-flowered rhododendron (Rhododendron albiflorum) and devil’s club (Oplopanax horri-dus). Overall, loss of compositional or functional diversity following harvest and site remedi-ation was not detected, suggesting that montane and subalpine forests in British Columbiaare resilient to this treatment. However, because these forests can be slow to recover fromdisturbance, the post-disturbance assessment window of this study may not have been longenough to detect diminishment of ecosystem resilience.",,British Columbia,55.001251,-125.002441,,10.1371/journal.pone.0172667,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0004.pdf,objects/small/journ0004_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0004_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,
journ0005,Rapid carbon accumulation following managed realignment on the Bay of Fundy,10021;10022;10023;,2018,['PLoS ONE'],"Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (persquare meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts,however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drainedand “reclaimed” for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshescan generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting onC burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 yearsold. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flood-ing to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canada’s Bay of Fundy. The C burialrate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reportedfor a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistentwith depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financialconstraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a consid-erable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to berecognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochtho-nous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.",,"Aulac, New Brunswick",45.8704653,-64.281406,,10.1371/journal.pone.0193930,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0005.pdf,objects/small/journ0005_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0005_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,
journ0006,Natural regeneration on seismic lines influences movement behaviour of wolves and grizzly bears,10024;10025;10026;10027;10028;10029;10030;10031;10032;,2018,['PLoS ONE'],"Across the boreal forest of Canada, habitat disturbance is the ultimate cause of caribou(Rangifer tarandus caribou) declines. Habitat restoration is a focus of caribou recoveryefforts, with a goal to finding ways to reduce predator use of disturbances, and caribou-pred-ator encounters. One of the most pervasive disturbances within caribou ranges in Alberta,Canada are seismic lines cleared for energy exploration. Seismic lines facilitate predatormovement, and although vegetation on some seismic lines is regenerating, it remainsunknown whether vegetation regrowth is sufficient to alter predator response. We usedLight Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and GPS locations, to understand how vegeta-tion and other attributes of seismic lines influence movements of two predators, wolves(Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos). During winter, wolves moved towards seis-mic lines regardless of vegetation height, while during spring wolves moved towards seismiclines with higher vegetation. During summer, wolves moved towards seismic lines withlower vegetation and also moved faster near seismic lines with vegetation <0.7 m. Seismiclines with lower vegetation height were preferred by grizzly bears during spring and summer,but there was no relationship between vegetation height and grizzly bear movement rates.These results suggest that wolves use seismic lines for travel during summer, but duringwinter wolf movements relative to seismic lines could be influenced by factors additional tomovement efficiency; potentially enhanced access to areas frequented by ungulate prey.Grizzly bears may be using seismic lines for movement, but could also be using seismiclines as a source of vegetative food or ungulate prey. To reduce wolf movement rate, resto-ration could focus on seismic lines with vegetation <1 m in height. However our resultsrevealed that seismic lines continue to influence wolf movement behaviour decades afterthey were built, and even at later stages of regeneration. Therefore it remains unknown atwhat stage of natural regeneration, if any, wolves cease to respond to seismic lines.

journ0007,Sheep dung input enhances arthropod biomass and a threatened insectivorous bird: Experimental management for conservation,10033;10034;10035;10036;10037;10038;10039;,2025,['Ecol Sol and Evidence'],"Abstract In recent decades, Europe has seen a notable decrease in extensive grazing by domestic livestock; endangering semi‐natural open habitats; and impacting soil, vegetation, arthropods and insectivores. Despite the known ecological consequences of grazing decline, little research has explored the role of sheep dung in influencing plant cover, arthropod biomass and higher trophic levels, such as insectivorous birds. To address this gap, a 3‐year study (2017–2019) was conducted in a Mediterranean shrub‐steppe in central Spain. Two 10‐hectare non‐grazed experimental plots received different doses of sheep dung, while a grazed area served as a reference. Vegetation structure was assessed annually, arthropods were sampled six times per year and the breeding space use of a threatened insectivorous bird was estimated annually. While dung input did not affect vegetation structure, it had short‐term positive effects on some arthropods, particularly epigeous and coprophagous species. Additionally, the insectivorous bird increased its use of space in response to dung application, likely due to the rise in arthropod biomass, a critical food resource. In areas where sheep grazing is declining, sheep dung inputs may serve as an effective short‐term strategy to increase the biomass of specific arthropod groups, indirectly benefiting their predators. Further research is needed to assess long‐term effects on arthropod communities and a wider range of insectivorous species, aiding conservation efforts in areas facing low grazing pressures.",,Mediterranean shrubsteppe in central Spain,,,,10.1002/2688-8319.70024,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0007.pdf,objects/small/journ0007_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0007_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,
journ0008,Challenges in the establishment of a rare plant species monitoring program using community science volunteers,10040;10041;10042;10043;,2024,['Ecol Sol and Evidence'],"Abstract Community science programs enable the collection of large amounts of important data and enhance the appreciation of science among members of the public. However, there are challenges in the establishment of successful community science programs. We report the challenges associated with the recent establishment of a community science program to monitor rare plants in the geographically diverse southern Illinois, USA region. Over the first 3 years, our program has been successful in the collection of over 250 monitoring records for rare species through the recruitment of a group of passionate volunteers. However, our volunteers are predominantly middle‐income, college educated, white females who are not representative of the population at large of the region. We propose a recruitment strategy to broaden the diversity of our volunteers by better engaging community members who are not typically involved with plant monitoring but are interested in hiking, walking in natural areas, gardening, and restoration activities, and others who would like the opportunity to collaborate with scientists and researchers in addressing an environmental issue. Practical implication: Community science plant monitoring programs face challenges in recruitment, retention, remoteness of field sites and data quality. Addressing these challenges through targeted recruitment strategies aimed at reducing structural and cultural barriers to participation, along with frequent program assessment, is necessary to enhance the success of these programs.",,"Southern Illinois, USA",37.7083423,-89.2275556,,10.1002/2688-8319.12400,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0008.pdf,objects/small/journ0008_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0008_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,
journ0009,Decades of artificial nests towards African penguin conservation—Have they made a difference?,10044;10045;10046;10047;10048;10049;10050;10051;10052;10053;10054;10055;10056;10057;10058;10059;10060;10061;10062;10063;10064;10065;10066;,2024,['Ecol Sol and Evidence'],"AbstractAfrican penguins are among the most threatened seabird species globally and an African Penguin Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) published in 2013 guides conservation strategies to prevent their extinction. To counter the impact of past guano exploitation which reduced the nesting habitat of these burrowing seabirds, rendering them vulnerable to predators and extreme weather events, a suite of artificial nests was deployed in various colonies over the past decades with varying success. The BMP called for new nest designs to maximise breeding output. This study assesses African penguin breeding success over the past 14 years in four types of artificial nests and in natural nests at all major colonies in South Africa. Overall, artificial nests outperformed natural nests and successfully increased breeding output of African penguins by 16.5% (95% CI: 6.7–26.2). No design was, however, consistently most effective across locations. For example, fibreglass nests had the poorest hatching success of all nest types at one colony (Bird Island), but outperformed cement nests at another (Boulders Beach). The latest design of double‐layered ceramic nests tended to perform better than other artificial nests, although not consistently at all colonies and occupancy rates were low in some areas. Practical implication. The deployment of artificial nests proved to be a successful conservation measure for African penguins although the variety of habitats in the different colonies seems to have prevented a one solution‐fits‐all approach. The consistent poor breeding output in some areas in all nest types (&lt;30% at the mainland colony in Simons' Town and the islands in Algoa Bay) further calls for colony‐specific conservation strategies beyond artificial nests, while the continuous decline in African penguin numbers globally calls for broader measures urgently, primarily increasing access to their forage fish prey.",,South Africa,-28.8166236,24.991639,,10.1002/2688-8319.12388,text,application/pdf,eng,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,pdf,/objects/journ0009.pdf,objects/small/journ0009_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0009_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,
