journ0002,Does restoration work? It depends on how we measure success,10002;10003;10004;10005;10006;,2018,"The restoration of 4 partial stream barriers was evaluated in watersheds of Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland, Canada from 2009 to 2011. Brook trout (n = 462) were tagged and tracked moving through our study sites using passive‐integrated transponder telemetry and the restoration actions were assessed using 3 different measures: passage success rates;the range of passable flows;and the availability of passable flows. We considered the observed results within a before‐after‐control‐impact (BACI) design that included reference reaches and pre‐restoration observations. The conclusions of BACI analyses were also contrasted with those that would have been obtained from commonly used before‐after (B‐A) or control‐impact (C‐I) study designs. While the restoration actions changed hydrological conditions in a way that should facilitate fish passage, our biological measures indicated that success was variable across culverts and within culverts depending on the measure evaluated. Furthermore, the natural temporal and spatial variability of fish movements often resulted in different conclusions between the more robust BACI design and the more commonly used B‐A and C‐I designs. Our results demonstrate that restoration of partial barriers may not always yield dramatic improvements. Furthermore, without suitable controls, the chances of drawing false conclusions regarding restorations in temporally and spatially dynamic systems are substantial.",,Terra Nova National Park,48.53323,-53.8919401,,10.1111/rec.12649,text,application/pdf,eng,,,pdf,/objects/journ0002.pdf,objects/small/journ0002_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0002_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
journ0001,Ecohydrological change following rewetting of a deep‐drained northern raised bog,10007;10008;10009;10010;10011;10012;,2020,"AbstractRestoration of degraded peatland ecosystems (by rewetting) is undertaken to bring back key ecosystem services. However, the restoration process can have a range of ecohydrological effects, due to the associated physical and biogeochemical disturbance. In the case of northern peatlands drained by large and deep ditches, the rewetting effects are relatively unknown. The raised bog Grande plée Bleue (1,500 ha) is one of the largest pristine bogs in the St‐Lawrence lowlands in North America;however, it contained an old (&gt;60 years), 750 m long, 3.5 m deep, and 8 m wide ditch. Rewetting of the area affected by the ditch was carried out by the construction of six dams at 40 cm elevation intervals and felling of all trees (with diameter at breast height &gt;10 cm) within 30 m. Water table was restored to levels similar to intact bog reference sites, only at elevation differences up to 17 cm from the nearest lower dam, while rewetting did not affect pore‐water chemistry. Five to 6 years post‐rewetting, the cover of both pioneer mosses, and late successional mosses (Sphagnum) had not changed significantly compared with pre‐rewetting. This may have been due to the presence of dense shrub cover. For more effective ecohydrological restoration, dams should be spaced at smaller elevation intervals (e.g., every 20 cm of elevation or less), to allow recovery of water table along the entire length of the ditch, and vegetation introduction using the moss layer transfer technique may accelerate Sphagnum recruitment, especially in the few first metres from the ditch.",,Grande plée Bleue,46.785692,-71.058227,,10.1002/eco.2210,text,application/pdf,eng,,,pdf,/objects/journ0001.pdf,objects/small/journ0001_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0001_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/
journ0003,Mine reclamation enhances habitats for wild ungulates in west‐central Alberta,10013;10014;,2020,"Surface mining is the most prevalent form of coal extraction in North America. Reclamation aims to transform former surface mines into self‐sustaining ecosystems that support uses similar to predevelopment conditions. Success of reclamation often is determined by assessing the re‐establishment of landscape structure and vegetation communities. However, there is increasing interest in evaluating reclamation success in the context of higher trophic levels. We evaluated response to mining and reclamation by sympatric bighorn sheep (Ovis canadanesis), elk (Cervus elaphus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) on reclaimed coal mines in west‐central Alberta. We used direct ground counts on a fixed survey route to obtain data on abundance and distribution of ungulates during 2004 to 2017. We created a grid of 200 × 200 m grid cells and assigned each group of ungulates to a grid cell. We assigned landscape and topographic features to these grid cells to represent changes due to mining and reclamation. We estimated resource selection functions for bighorn sheep, elk, and mule deer showing how their use of reclaimed features and landscapes increased access to quality forage and decreased predation risk. Ungulates also responded to mining and reclamation in ways that we did not anticipate, e.g. sheep and elk often selected areas near haul roads. Understanding spatial relationships between reclamation prescriptions and higher trophic levels is important when designing “bottom up” reclamation to restore ecological functions including recruitment of wildlife.",,West-central Alberta,53.022382,-112.8354598,,10.1111/rec.13137,text,application/pdf,eng,,,pdf,/objects/journ0003.pdf,objects/small/journ0003_sm.jpg,objects/small/journ0003_sm.jpg,An image of the first page of the journal article.,,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
